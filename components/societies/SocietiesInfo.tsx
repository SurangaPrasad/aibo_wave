        <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 text-center">
          AIBO Wave Societies are local chapters of our global community, inspired by 
          organizations like Rotary and Lions Club. Each Society is led by passionate 
          community members who organize local projects, manage community funds, and 
          promote AIBO Wave&apos;s mission in their region.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-center">
          By joining a Society, you become part of a supportive network that celebrates 
          local culture, supports emerging artists and entrepreneurs, and creates meaningful 
          social impact through collaborative projects and community-driven initiatives.
